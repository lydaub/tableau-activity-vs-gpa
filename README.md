# 📊 Physical Activity & GPA Analysis 
### 🔍 Overview

This Tableau project explores the relationship between physical activity behaviors (steps, peak active minutes, fat-burn minutes, life score, etc.) and student GPA ranges.
The dashboard uses a podium-style visualization, where each podium represents a GPA category: Low, Medium, and High.Users can interact with each podium to reveal detailed charts and insights.

#### 🎯 Objectives & Goals

- Analyze how physical activity levels differ across GPA ranges.
- Help students understand how movement and wellness might connect to academic outcomes.
- Present a visually engaging, beginner-friendly Tableau dashboard.
- Provide actionable insights for motivation, resource connection, and physical activity improvement.

#### 🛠️ Methodology
- Data Preparation
- Cleaned the dataset by removing missing activity days and duplicates.
- Renamed columns for readability and Tableau compatibility.
- Converted timestamps into standard date formats.
- Organized GPA into three ranges: Low, Medium, and High.

Structured metrics such as:
- Average Steps
- Peak Active Moments
- Fat Burn Minutes
- Life Score

#### Dashboard Structure

Three-podium design: each podium displays aggregated metrics for a GPA range. When clicked, the podium opens a larger visualization showing deeper trends. Includes segment cards that summarize core metrics (e.g., Steps, Life Score). Heatmap used to display Life Score variations across time.

#### 📈 Key Visualizations
- Podium dashboard with interactive GPA categories
- Steps vs. GPA graph
- Peak Active Moments comparison
- Life Score heatmap
- Segment cards with simplified metrics for first-time learners

#### 🧠 Insights & Findings
- Higher GPA groups showed more consistent movement patterns and higher daily averages.
- The Medium GPA group had the most variability in daily activity.
- Life Score visualizations suggest that steady physical activity may correlate with stronger academic performance.
- Engagement-focused visuals (podium + cards) make it easier for new users to understand the story behind the data.
